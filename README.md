# Eyedra

I made a funny state machine visualization to understand better state machines. There is a monster that called eyedra it has 3 states: idle, track, reset. All eyes have have its own state machine.

In idle state, its all eyes randomly moves.
In track state, all eyes tracks mouse cursor.
In reset state, after mouse cursor exits track area, its eyes goes back to initial position
